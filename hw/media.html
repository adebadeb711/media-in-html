            <em>Dhaka Residential Model College</em> was established in 1960 by the President of Pakistan, Field Marshal
            Ayub Khan, on an
            area on about 52 acres along Mirpur Road near Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka.
        </p>

        <p>In 1962, the then East Pakistan Provincial Government took over the administrative responsibility of Dhaka
            Residential
            Model College. In 1965, the government converted the institution into an autonomous institution and its
            administration
            was entrusted to a Board of Governors with the Chief Secretary as its Chairman. In 1967, the government
            again took
            control of the school. At that time, a new Board of Governors was formed with the Education Secretary as its
            Chairman.
            The school started its XI and XII classes in 1967.
        </p>
        <p>The primary purpose of establishing the DRMC was to provide education for the children of the elite military
            officers
            and high-ranking government officials of East Pakistan. The school, later the college, was modeled after
            public schools
            in the United Kingdom (as per the British Public Schools Act 1868), particularly Eton College.
        </p>
        <p>
            The school's house system was modelled on Eton. After Bangladesh's independence, a Board of Governors was
            appointed with
            the Education Secretary as its chairman. Since its establishment, the school has been financed by government
            grants and
            minimal student fees. The Board of Governors is empowered to "make such rules as may be necessary for the
            proper
            functioning of the school".
        </p>

            The school started with only the morning shift, which runs from 07:30 AM to 12:10 PM. In March 1993, another
            shift known
            as the day shift was added in accordance with the government's education expansion policy to cope with the
            increasing
            number of students. The day shift runs from 12:30 PM to 5:10 PM.
